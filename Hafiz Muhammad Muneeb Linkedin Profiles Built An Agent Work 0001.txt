
🚀 I built an AI-powered software house — with agents doing real teamwork!
Instead of humans shouting “file bhej do bhai!”, I made agents silently do all the work — in proper workflow 👨‍💻✨
Here's how it works (and yes, I coded all of this myself 😎 using OpenAI Agents SDK, Gemini API, and Streamlit):
🔁 Multi-Agent Workflow Breakdown:
🧠 1. BlogWriter Agent
Writes a full SEO blog based on the user’s prompt
Think of it as your creative copywriter on autopilot
➡️ Sends the raw blog content to ProofReader Agent
🧹 2. ProofReader Agent
Fixes grammar, structure, and tone
Polishes the content like an English teacher with OCD
➡️ Passes the cleaned content to Decorator Agent
🎨 3. Decorator Agent
Adds formatting, subheadings, emojis, bold highlights etc.
Makes the blog visually attractive and readable
➡️ Hands off the styled blog to the SEO Agent
🔍 4. SEO Agent
Optimizes the blog with trending keywords, title, meta description
Ensures your content is Google’s new best friend 💡
➡️ Delivers the FINAL OUTPUT to the user
✅ Result:
 A fully optimized, proofed, decorated blog — created end-to-end by AI agents, no manual editing needed.
💻 Built With:
Python (async + modular architecture)
Streamlit (fast UI for user prompt & results)
OpenAI Agents SDK (to manage each agent)
Gemini API (as the AI engine for deep reasoning)
🎥 I recorded the whole thing — from code to workflow in action.
 Yes, I wrote every line of code and handled the agent orchestration myself (no copy-paste magic).
⚒️ What’s next?
 Scaling this architecture to build:
Resume Builders
YouTube Script Kits
Affiliate Blog Writers
Legal Document Makers
 ... all powered by multiple agents in one automated chain.

“Pre-Primary students at The Generation School participated in a lively activity to learn about vowels (A, E, I, O, U).
 Children actively engaged in recognizing vowel sounds, and their joyful participation was captured in pictures and videos. 
Such activities make learning interactive, fun, and memorable.”
